# Carerra ðŸš— - Porsche Museum AI Assistant

## Overview

Carerra ðŸš— is an AI assistant designed to provide information and answer questions related to the Porsche Museum. This Streamlit app utilizes sentence embeddings and vector indexing to retrieve relevant answers from a pre-defined database of questions and answers. If a specific question is not found in the database, the app uses a transformer-based language model to generate an answer dynamically.

## Features

- Retrieve answers to predefined questions about the Porsche Museum.
- Dynamic generation of answers using a transformer-based language model.
- Streamlit interface for user interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App

Run the following command to launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. Enter your question in the text input field.
2. Carerra ðŸš— will retrieve the most similar question from the database and provide an answer.

## Customization

Feel free to expand the question and answer database in `qa_database` for a richer set of interactions. You can also fine-tune the transformer-based language model for more accurate and context-aware answers.

## Extending the Database

To add more questions and answers to the database, simply update the `qa_database` dictionary in the `app.py` file. Ensure that each question is associated with a corresponding answer.

```python
qa_database = {
    "New Question": "Corresponding Answer",
    # Add more questions and answers as needed
}
```
